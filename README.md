# Vim Stack - The Mephux Collection.

## Why?

  I want a good quality vim setup that does not depend on ruby, perl or python. Just pure old vimscript for
  easy deployment to whatever box I am currently using.

  Vimux by default is mostly setup for work in ruby, javascript, html, css, go and c. However, adding plugins to extend
  it for whatever tools you need is trivial.

  Vimux comes with two color schemas: epix and threatstack. Both color schemas were created by me modified from 
  ir_black (https://github.com/wesgibbs/vim-irblack). The default color schema is threatstack.

## Install

  * `make install`
  * `vim +BundleInstall +qall # install all default plugins`

## Commands

  NOTE: The default `<Leader>` is set to `\`

  * `ctrl + p`  - fuzzy file finder via ctrlp (https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
  * `<Leader>b` - ctrlp buffer search
  * `<Leader>f` - ctrlp function search
  * `<c-f>`     - search via Ack (https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim - `brew install ack` or `sudo apt-get install ack-grep`)
  * `<Leader>o` - git commit viewer via vim-extradite (https://github.com/int3/vim-extradite)
  * `<Leader>q` - quickfix
  * `<Leader>w` - write file
  * `shift+s"`  - surround selected char/word with ""
  * `<Leader>c` - toggle software caps lock
  * `<Leader>p` - toggle paste mode

## HTML

  * Invoke html completion with `ctrl + e` using emmet-vim (https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim)

  * Example
    - `div#hello` followed by `ctrl + e` = `<div id="hello"></div>`
    - `div.world` followed by `ctrl + e` = `<div class="word"></div>`
    - etc..

## Uninstall

  `make uninstall` or `make clean`

## TODO
  * I need to clean up the vimrc - it's a crazy mess but it's solid.
